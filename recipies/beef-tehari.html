        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>A fragrant and spicy rice dish made with Chinigura rice, tender beef pieces, 
            and a heavy emphasis on mustard oil and green chilies for that signature kick.</p>

                <li>Chinigura rice</li>
                <li>Beef cubes</li>
                <li>Mustard oil</li>
                <li>Yogurt</li>
                <li>ginger-garlic paste</li>

        <h2>steps</h2>
        <!-- ordered list of steps -->
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Marinate the Beef:</strong> Mix small beef cubes with ginger-garlic paste, yogurt, salt, 
                and a spice blend of cardamom, cinnamon, and mace. Let it sit for at least 30 minutes.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Cook the Meat:</strong> Heat mustard oil in a heavy-bottomed pot. Sauté sliced onions 
                until golden, then add the marinated beef. Cook until the meat is tender and the oil
                 separates from the spices.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Prepare the Rice:</strong> In a separate pot, lightly fry the soaked Chinigura rice 
                in a bit of ghee and whole green chilies until the grains look translucent.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Combine:</strong> Add the cooked beef (along with its flavorful oil) to the rice. 
                Pour in hot water (the ratio is usually 2:1 water to rice).</li>
                
                <li><strong>The Dum:</strong> Once the water level drops to the surface of the rice,
                cover the pot tightly. Lower the heat to the absolute minimum and let 
                it steam (Dum) for 20 minutes until the rice is fluffy and fragrant.</li>
            </ol>
