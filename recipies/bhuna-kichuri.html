        <h2>steps</h2>
        <!-- ordered list of steps -->
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Roast the Dal:</strong> Dry roast the Moong Dal in a pan on medium 
                heat until it turns golden brown and smells nutty. Wash it and set aside.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Sauté Aromatics:</strong> Heat ghee or oil in a pot. Add whole spices
                (bay leaf, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon) and sliced onions. Fry until the onions are translucent.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Fry Rice and Dal:</strong> Add the washed Kalojira rice and roasted dal to the pot. 
                Stir-fry them together for 3–4 minutes; this ensures the Khichuri stays grainy and "Bhuna."</li>
                
                <li><strong>Season:</strong> Stir in turmeric, ginger paste, and salt.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Boil:</strong> Add hot water and bring to a boil. Once the water starts to dry up, 
                tuck in a few whole green chilies for flavor.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Final Steam:</strong> Cover the pot tightly with a lid. Cook on very low heat for 
                15 minutes.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Fry the Eggs:</strong> While the rice steams, boil eggs, peel them, score the sides, 
                and deep-fry them with a pinch of salt and turmeric until the skin is crispy and golden. Serve them 
                on top of the Khichuri.</li>
            </ol>
